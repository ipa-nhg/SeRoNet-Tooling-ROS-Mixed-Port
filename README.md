This repository holds the implementation of the ROS-SeRoNet Mixed Port component within the SeRoNet Tooling, its eclipse facilities, and realted examples. 

The SeRoNet Tooling is developed by the SeRoNet Project consortium: http://www.seronet-projekt.de

The ROS Mixed-Port Component is developed by:
* Service Robotics Research Center of Ulm University of Applied Sciences
* Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA

**CAUTION: This software is a preview for the purpose of technology demonstration. It is experimental and comes with no support. Use at your own risk.**


The implemenentation of the ROS-SeRoNet Mixed-Port component is realized as a Domain-Specific Language (DSL):.

- **RosInterfacesPool**: This is a stand-alone DSL that defines a pool of ROS interface specifications that is used by the next DSL to select the ROS-related communication interfaces of a SeRoNet Mixed-Port component.

- Example for **RosInterfacesPool** DSL can be found here: example/joy.rosinterfacespool

Technical Maintainer: [**ipa-nhg**](https://github.com/ipa-nhg/) (**Nadia Hammoudeh Garcia**, **Fraunhofer IPA**) and [**alex-lotz**](https://github.com/alex-lotz) (**Alex Lotz**, **Hochschule Ulm**)

The Eclipse plugins in this repository are part of the SeRoNet Tooling and are not supposed to be used stand-alone. A full installer for the SeRoNet Tooling is going to be released in soon.
